# deeplearning-notes

## Where have these notes come from?

Notes accumulated from studying various deep learning courses, primarily:
* [fast.ai](https://www.fast.ai) - "Practical Deep Learning for Coders" and "Cutting Edge Deep Learning for Coders".
* [Andrew Ng's Deep Learning Specialisation](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/deep-learning)

## Which is better?

*fast.ai*, for sure. Sorry, Andrew Ng.
