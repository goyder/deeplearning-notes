    "### LeNet-5\n",
    "\n",
    "A classic in the field. [LeNet-5](http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/lenet/), named after its inventor, LeCun, was an early convolutional network.\n",
    "\n",
    "Its structure is very similiar to modern convolutional networks. Some notably interests include:\n",
    "* Use of sigmoid/tanh activations\n",
    "* Use of average pooling\n",
    "\n",
    "An implementation can be found [here](http://deeplearning.net/tutorial/lenet.html).\n",
    "\n",
    "### AlexNet\n",
    "\n",
    "A break-away success - [AlexNet](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AlexNet) outperformed the running up by more than 10 percentage points in a top-5 metric in 2012. This model used an earlier version of CUDA for training and performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "It made use of:\n",
    "* ReLU activations\n",
    "* Multiple GPUs\n",
    "* Local Response Normalisation (LRN)\n",
    "\n",
    "Relatively straightforward paper.\n",
    "\n",
    "### VGG-16\n",
    "\n",
    "Notably both for its success and its simplicity. VGG-16 cut down on the complexity by focusing primarily on $(3\\times3)$ convolutional filters and ($2\\times2, s=2$) max pools.\n",
    "\n",
    "The paper is [widely available](https://arxiv.org/abs/1409.1556).\n",
    "\n",
    "### ResNet\n",
    "\n",
    "Notable for its implementation of \"skip\" layers, which allowed for the training of exceedingly deep networks. VGG-16 was 16 layers - ResNet was 152 layers deep.\n",
    "\n",
    "The paper is available [here](https://arxiv.org/abs/1512.03385).\n",
